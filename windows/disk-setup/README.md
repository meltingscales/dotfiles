# Notes

## Concerns

-   Bootstrap malware from D: onto C:
    -   Can I lock D: as RO if not mounted? Probably not. Oh well.

# C:/
-   "OS"
-   Bitlocker 256 AES
-   OS files
-   Cloud storage

# D:/
-   "dont-encrypt"
-   SteamApps, Epic Games Store, etc
-   Large non-sensitive files
-   Virtual machines
